## How to build

```bash
npm run build
```

A `dist` folder should be created.

## How to preview the build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## How to host

Here is a guide: [How to deploy the project](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Daily_fitness_app_ReactNative/blob/main/HOW_TO_DEPLOY.MD)

## My process

### Built with

- React Native
- Expo Router
- TailwindCSS
- Reanimated
- Rapid API
- Caching techniques

### What I learned

Working on this project allowed me to delve deep into mobile app development using React Native and Expo. I learned how to integrate animations with Reanimated and manage data efficiently using caching techniques. I also explored fetching data from external APIs like Rapid API to provide dynamic content.

### Continued development

I aim to add more features such as user authentication, personalized workout plans, and real-time progress tracking. I also plan to enhance the user interface with more animations and interactive elements.
